# 📘 Induced EMF per Turn — Square Waveform Derivation

This document gives a full derivation of the **induced EMF per turn** in a transformer or inductor core when the applied voltage is a **square waveform**, using first principles.

## ⚙️ 1. Starting Principle — Faraday's Law

The fundamental equation governing electromagnetic induction is:

e(t) = -N dϕ(t)/dt

Where:
- `e(t)` is the instantaneous induced EMF  
- `N` is the number of turns  
- `ϕ(t)` is the magnetic flux through the core  

For EMF per turn, we set `N = 1`:

e(t) = -dϕ(t)/dt

## 📐 2. Applied Voltage: Square Waveform

Let the applied voltage be a **symmetrical square wave** of:
- Peak voltage: `V_m`
- Frequency: `f` (Hz)
- Time period: `T = 1/f`

v(t) =
+V_m for 0 ≤ t < T/2
-V_m for T/2 ≤ t < T

Since:

v(t) = dϕ(t)/dt

We integrate to get flux:

ϕ(t) = ∫v(t) dt


## 📈 3. Flux Waveform: Triangular

**First Half (0 to T/2):**

ϕ(t) = V_m · t


**Second Half (T/2 to T):**

ϕ(t) = V_m · (T/2) - V_m · (t - T/2)


**Peak flux:**

ϕ_m = V_m · T/2 = V_m / (2f)


## ⚡ 4. Induced EMF: Differentiate Flux

From Faraday's Law:

e(t) = -dϕ(t)/dt

Since ϕ(t) is linear in each half cycle:

|dϕ/dt| = 2·ϕ_m / T = 2f·ϕ_m

So:

E_peak_per_turn = 2f · B_m · A_n

Where:
- `B_m` is the peak flux density (T)
- `A_n` is the net core area (m²)

## 📊 5. RMS Value of Square Wave

Since the waveform is square:

E_rms = E_peak = 2 f B_m A_n

## ✅ Final Formula

**Per Turn:**

E = 2 f B_m A_n



**For N turns:**

E = 2 f N B_m A_n
